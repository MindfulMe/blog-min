Additionally, 22 percent began searching in newspaper ads and 8 percent used friend&rsquo;s referrals. There is still more room for online searches to grow as tech-sophisticated Millenials and Gen Z increasingly becomes prospective home buyers.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I suspect that those figures do not tell the whole picture because the home-buying population is skewed towards older and more established individuals and families. We can infer that the vast majority of home buyers under 35 will begin their home search with online listings. This means we can expect the power of online listings to grow in the future. If you are intending to sell a real estate property and don&rsquo;t make the digital listing a priority you may be seriously compromising results.</p><p><br></p><p>BitOLX lists a range of properties and businesses, but the focus on quality listings is constant. The definition of quality is meeting or exceeding expectations. The home is one area in particular where buyers are unlikely to compromise on quality if they can avoid it. Despite this growing trend of online search, 81 percent of home buyers used a broker in their transaction. We can infer that technology has not entirely replaced the faith that buyers place in brokers.</p><p><br></p><p>Brokers do have valuable information about specific markets, and because purchasing real estate is such a great commitment and the stakes are so high, it&rsquo;s reasonable to expect brokers to play a role in the foreseeable future. BitOLX is the only online real estate property search portal that both attracts the best brokers as well as provides a great amount of transparency.</p><p><br></p><p>Source - <a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2019-real-estate-in-a-digital-age-08-22-2019.pdf\"></a><a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2019-real-estate-in-a-digital-age-08-22-2019.pdf\">https://www.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2019-real-estate-in-a-digital-age-08-22-2019.pdf</a></p><p><br></p><p>&mdash;if expanding the article.</p><p>The average home buyer considers 10 homes before deciding on one.
